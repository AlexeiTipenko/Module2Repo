# Exercise 5 (Mining twitter)

In this exercise, I have made a twitter account, created a new twitter application, 
retrieved a variety of keys and used them to gather data containing a hashtag for "hist3814o"

In the following logs, I installed twarc and configured it. I made a search for data containing
the hist3814o hashtag and piped the data into the search.json file. I then installed a json to 
csv converter and converted the json file into an out.csv file. 

Note: I had some difficulty with saving certain files into the wrong directory, so I tried using
the mv command to come the files. I later realized you could do it straight from the file manager.
