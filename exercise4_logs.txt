# Exercise 4 (API's)

For this exercise, I used an API to get a series of records in json form.
The search criteria were "ottawa" and all records between year 1800 and 1802.

After creating the directory for this exercise, I made a shell file that calls 
an API to get certain records from search.canadiana.ca. I then set the permissions
for the shell file and executed it. The result was "output.txt", a file that contained
a neat collection of json records that can easily be analyzed in the future. 

History logs: 

    1  ls
    2  history
    3  sudo apt-get install jq -y
    4  pwd
    5  ls
    6  cd module2repo/
    7  ls
    8  mkdir m2e4
    9  cd m2e4
   10  ls
   11  pwd
   12  touch canadiana.sh
   13  ls
   14  nano canadiana.sh 
   15  chmod 755 canadiana.sh
   16  ./canadiana.sh
   17  pwd
   18  ls
   19  nano output.txt
   20  history
   21  cd ..
   22  ls
   23  history > m2e4.md
   24  history > m2e4.txt
