# The Dream Case Record

## Epigraphic Database Heidelberg

For this database, I wanted to find epigraph inscriptions that were made by a regular person. As I looked through the advanced 
search, I found the option to choose "slaves". I thought this might be an interesting set of data, given the fact that 
slaves would not be important enough to have their names added to a statue or a building. To narrow down the search results, I decided 
to also add "Italy" as the modern country. This is because Italy has the most amount of epigraphs associated with slaves.

The results I found were interesting. The majority of inscriptions came from the ancient province of Roma. This is understandable, 
as it is the capital region of Italy to this day, and it implies that a large percentage of slaves were located there.

The other interesting finding is that about 75 percent of all epigraphs were actually "epitaphs". An epitaph is an inscription
typically found on a tombstone to commemorate a loved one who has passed away. This makes sense, as tombstones are not nearly
as expensive or important as a statue or government building. About half of all epigraphs were labeled as "tabula" for type
of monument. Another quarter were labeled as "steele". So these monuments were almost always tombstones, small stone "tablets" 
or perhaps pieces of metal with engravings on them. 

A great number of these epigraphs were labeled from around 5 BC to 204 AD. Between these two time periods, there was an average
of about 75 epigraphs per year. There were some sharp declines in the years 204, 231, 251 and 301 AD. After that, the number of
epigraphs stayed consistently at 3 epigraphs per year (until 400 AD). It would be interesting to find out why these sudden drops occured by 
looking at the various provinces in ancient Italy at the time.

## Commwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead

When searching for my last name "Tipenko", I could not find any results on this website. I instead tried to search
for my first name "Alexei" and narrowed down the irrelevant results by putting an "A" in the initials search box.

This search gave me 4 results. Two Alexeis were from the Russian Army. This is unsurprising, as the name has mostly been 
used in Russia and the Soviet Union. These two men had similar identification numbers and their recorded country of death 
was Belgium. They were also burried in the same cemetary very close to each other. Based off of this information, its 
very likely that two soldiers fought side by side and died together. Another Alexei was part of the German Army and died
in the United Kingdom in 1945. The last name was "Alexeio Piceto" was a cook for the Indian Merchant Navy. His name appeared
on a memorial in Bombay, whose dates span from 1939 to 1945.

Althought there were only 4 records on my name, the insights found in this database were somewhat insightful.

A downloaded .csv file containing this information can be can be found in the same directory (m2e1).
