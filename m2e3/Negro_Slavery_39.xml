                    must be much more oppressive than it is even in the
                    <placeName key="United States" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</placeName>,
                    would seem to be established beyond controversy by the following comparative statement of the Negro population of <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>
                    and of the <placeName key="United States" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</placeName>,
                    in the years 1790 and 1820.</p>

                <p>
                    In 1790, the number of slaves in
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>
                    is stated by
                    <persName key="Edwards, Bryan" from="1743" to="1800" role="Jamaican planter and politician" ref="http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/54/2/215">Bryan Edwards</persName> at
                    <interp key="book" n="Edwards, Bryan, and William Young. The History of the British Colonies in the West Indies. Printed    for J. Stockdale, 1801." cert="medium" ref="https://archive.org/details/historycivilcomm04edwa">250,000, which, however, he considered under-rated.
                    </interp>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1810, from the calculations founded on the
                    <interp key="Government Document" n="unknown" cert="high" ref="unknown">Reports
                    </interp> of the Assembly of
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>,
                    they must have been about 320,000. - In 1817, they were rated, on what was affirmed to be a
                    more accurate census, at 345,252, being an addition of only 95,252, in the whole of that period;
                     and yet from the year appear to have been added by importation from
                     <placeName key="Africa" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</placeName>
                     to the stock in that
                     <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">island</placeName>,
                     though the commencement of that importation is four years prior to 1791; yet this will
                     probably be counterbalanced by the admitted inaccuracy of the returns in 1791.
                 </p>

                <p>
                    In the year 1790, the slave population of the whole of the
                    <placeName key="United States" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</placeName>
                    was 676,696. In the year 1800 it was 894,444. In 1810 1,191,364. In 1820 1,531,431.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The natural increase would have appeared to be considerably greater, if 174,142 has not been added
                    to the free Blacks during that period, about 100,000 of them by manumission. - We see that between
                    1790 and 1800 the rate of increase was 28.25 per cent. Between 1800 and 1810 33.125 per cent. And
                    between 1810 and 1820 28.5 per cent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The small difference in the increase from 1800 to 1810 must be attributed to the partial importation from
                    <placeName key="Africa" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</placeName>
                    during a short part of that period, but this will be far more than counterbalanced by the number manumitted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1790, then,
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>
                    had a slave population of above 250,000. In 1817 and in 1820, (the number will probably be
                    found nearly the same in both years,) 345,252. In 1791, the
                    <placeName key="United States" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</placeName>
                    slave population was 676,696. In 1820, ditto, ditto, 1,531,431.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a system not more rigorous than the American system had been pursued in
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>,
                    the population of that
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">island</placeName>
                    ought to have been in the year 1820, 565, 775.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With 188,785 added by importation, still the population of
                    <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>
                    falls 220,523 short of what it ought to have been, making a different altogether
